animationState should hold position 
How to get position of mesh that was moved by physics
  Should we use ref to get position ?
  It seems Rapier overwrites the position ?
  Could always use Rapier RigidBody and not Motion
    Can Motion update the position of the RigidBody ? Probably not expecting Rapier
  Have different strategy for different objects e.g. treat as RigidBody only 
DynamicDoubleArrow not getting latest position - probably not re-rendering because not depending on position ? 
Bottom down and top up should be connected on id using DynamicDoubleArrow with offset
Move to using Motion for Canvas and Camera control ?
Allow multiple scenes
Do we need a physics system? Not now. https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier is a good option
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0 only in CodeSpace ?
React dev server not working?
