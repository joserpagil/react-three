add text objects
Pass down variants from DouobleArrow etc ?
Having variants in the emergentEntity for the "appearance" of the parts and adding text.
Handling of the position updates needs more work
Compare with manim animation
Do we need a physics system? Not now. https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier is a good option
